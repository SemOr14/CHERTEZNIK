"Cherteznik" is a school project.
It's a machine that can draw drafts.
In application for converting .svg files of "layers" (we're changing a pencil to use different hardness) 
to the only one .gcode file, which we use for "Cherteznik", we used this project: https://github.com/sameer/svg2gcode/.
The application is in the folder named "Cherteznik". You can find .exe file here, which you need to use to open an app.
In folder named "3D_models" you can find 3d models of "Cherteznik".
3d models made in FreeCad (https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD/releases).
Our code is written in C# programming language with using .NET Framework platform (more specifically, WinForms).
